            </h2>

            <p>
                Bryana was born and raised in Michigan, but came to Chattanooga in 2006 for school. She lived in Denmark for a year and worked at a high school boarding academy as an Assistant Dean. She has visited fourteen countries and almost ran with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                She enjoys electronic dance music and modern jazz, specifically from the UK.  She enjoys being in the sunshine whether that means sitting in her backyard or driving into the sunset (it's good for the retinas).
