1) Quiz is launched and we need to include:
    - Ask the user's name. Their name should be used in subsequent prompts
    - Confirm that the user really wants to take the quiz. If not, return from your event listener function.
    - Three YES/NO questions (using prompt calls) about the subject. Use your countsAsAYes function to determine the user's response, then compare to the correct answer. Track number of correct responses.
    - Alert the user that the quiz is complete and their results will now be written to the webpage.
    - Write a response to the page with their name and number correct out of the total. For example: "Okay Bernice, you got 2/3 correct".
